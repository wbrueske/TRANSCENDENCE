# TRANSCENDENCE
WIP website for my own personal sci-fi universe.

Currently configuring the website layout and functionality before adding too much content.  So far all that's complete is the encyclopedia layout (fully responsive), and the solar "map," but only for desktop displays (responsive layout still to come).
