# TRANSCENDENCE
WIP website for my own personal sci-fi universe.

Currently configuring the website layout and functionality before adding too much content.  So far all that's complete is the solar "map," but only for large screens and powerful computers (the images are far too enormous right now); mobile-friendly to come later.
